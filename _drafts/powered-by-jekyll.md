Inspired by the [brander newer](http://daverupert.com/2012/11/brander-newer/) version of Dave Rupert's blog I decided to make the switch from WordPress to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It basically takes a template directory, runs it through some Markdown and Liquid converters and spits out a completely static website.
