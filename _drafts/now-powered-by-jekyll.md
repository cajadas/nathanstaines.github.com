Inspired by the [brander newer](http://daverupert.com/2012/11/brander-newer/) version of Dave Rupert's blog I decided to make the switch from WordPress to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a simple, blog aware, static site generator written by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/). It basically takes a template directory, runs it through some Markdown and Liquid converters and spits out a completely static website.

At first static websites can be a little tricky to get your head around. It's true that you'll need to get your hands dirty using the commandline. It kind of feels like a bit of a throwback to the good old days when I first started developing for the web, back when I had no idea what I was doing. No database, no backend code just pure front-end development before front-end development was even a thing.

### Now hosted on GitHub

If you've ever used [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) before then you've already experienced Jekyll in action. Every GitHub Page is run through Jekyll when you push content to your repo. This means that you can host your Jekyll powered site on GitHub for free, instantly deploy your content and have every change under version control.

- Deployment process
- Using plugins

### Now styled with Sass

### Now even faster

- Page speed tests

Jeklly works in a similar fashion, except it creates the links between files for you.
On the surface it would appear that very litte has changed. However, it's under the hood that the magic happens.
*I remember simply creating a bunch of individual `html` files then linking to them directly from one another.*
